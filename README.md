# Infinite Tensor Operations

A Python library for performing operations on tensors with infinite dimensions using a sliding window approach.

## Overview

This library enables easy processing of theoretically infinite tensors by splitting them into chunks. All tensors can have operations applied to them in a sliding window manner, without the need to load the entire tensor into memory. Tensor memory management is handled automatically to ensure memory and disk usage is minimal.
